It also includes other kinds of accounts that have the general characteristics of demand deposits in that the customer may deposit additional funds at any time and also effectively may withdraw funds at any time without prior notice or penalty. Cash equivalents, excluding items classified as marketable securities, include Short-Term, highly liquid Investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity that they present minimal risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally, only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify under that definition. Original maturity means original maturity to the entity holding the investment. For example, both a three-month US Treasury bill and a three-year Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. However, a Treasury note purchased three years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months. Short-term investments, exclusive of cash equivalents, are marketable securities intended to be sold within one year (or the normal operating cycle if longer) and include trading securities, available-for-sale securities, and held-to-maturity securities (if maturing within one year).

However, a Treasury note purchased three years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months. Compensating balance arrangements that do not legally restrict the withdrawal or usage of cash equivalents may be reported as cash equivalents, while legally restricted equivalents held as compensating balances against borrowing arrangements, contracts entered into with others, or company statements of intention with regard to particular equivalents should not be reported as part of unrestricted cash equivalents.

DisposalGroupIncludingDiscontinuedOperationCashAndCashEquivalents	us-gaap/2009	0	0	monetary	I	D	Disposal Group, Including Discontinued Operation, Cash and Cash Equivalents	For the disposal group, including a component of the entity (discontinued operation), cash includes currency on hand as well as demand deposits with banks or financial institutions. Cash equivalents, excluding items classified as marketable securities, include short-term, highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally, only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify under that definition. Original maturity means original maturity to the entity holding the investment. For example, both a three-month US Treasury bill and a three-year Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. However, a Treasury note purchased three years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months.

The direct method requires classification of operating expenses into classes that provide a meaningful breakdown of operating receipts and payments and usually includes the classifications cash collected from customers, interest and dividends received, other cash received, cash paid to employees, cash paid to suppliers, interest paid, income taxes paid and other operating payments.

OtherAdditionalCapital	us-gaap/2008	0	0	monetary	I	C	Other Additional Capital	Additional paid-in capital or capital from other sources not otherwise defined. Additional paid-in capital primarily results from capital contributed by shareholders in excess of the par or stated value of the common or preferred stock issued by an entity.

Therefore, some entities consider additional paid-in capital to have two components: capital in excess of par or stated value and other additional capital. Use this element if the registrant wishes to distinguish between Additional paid-in-capital from Other Additional Capital. The following adjustments are some examples of Other Additional Capital: recording the issuance of debt issued with a beneficial conversion feature, the issuance of convertible debt at a substantial premium, certain tax consequences of equity instruments awarded to employees, and accounting for certain expenses and liabilities paid for by the principal shareholder.

Based on available evidence, the future revenue will be provided to permit recovery of the previously incurred cost rather than to provide for expected levels of similar future costs.

CashAndCashEquivalentsOfConsolidatedInvestmentProducts	0000950123-09-028100	1	0	monetary	I	D	Cash and cash equivalents of consolidated investment products	Includes currency of the entity's consolidated investment products on hand as well as demand deposits with banks or financial institutions. It also includes other kinds of accounts held by the entity's consolidated investment products that have the general characteristics of demand deposits in that the consolidated investment products may deposit additional funds at any time and also effectively may withdraw funds at any time without prior notice or penalty. Cash equivalents, excluding items classified as marketable securities, include short-term, highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity that they present minimal risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally, only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify under that definition. Original maturity means original maturity to the entity holding the investment. For example, both a three-month US Treasury bill and a three-year Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. However, a Treasury note purchased three years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months.

DeferredTaxLiabilitiesAndLiabilitiyForUncertainTaxPositionsNonCurrent	0000950123-09-030883	1	0	monetary	I	C	Deferred Tax Liabilities And Liabilitiy For Uncertain Tax Positions Non Current	Represents the noncurrent portion of deferred tax liabilities, which result from applying the applicable tax rate to net taxable temporary differences pertaining to each jurisdiction to which the entity is obligated to pay income tax. A noncurrent taxable temporary difference is a difference between the tax basis and the carrying amount of a noncurrent asset or liability in the financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In a classified statement of financial position, an enterprise shall separate deferred tax liabilities and assets into a current amount and a noncurrent amount. Deferred tax liabilities and assets shall be classified as current or noncurrent based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting. A deferred tax liability or asset that is not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting, including deferred tax assets related to carryforwards, shall be classified according to the expected reversal date of the temporary difference. Liability for uncertain tax positions is the noncurrent portion of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions as of the balance sheet date.

CashAndCashEquivalents	0000950123-09-030946	1	0	monetary	I	D	Cash and cash equivalents	Includes currency on hand as well as demand deposits with banks or financial institutions. It also includes other kinds of accounts that have the general characteristics of demand deposits in that the Entity may deposit additional funds at any time and also effectively may withdraw funds at any time without prior notice or penalty. Cash equivalents, excluding items classified as marketable securities, include short-term, highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity that they present minimal risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally, only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify under that definition. Original maturity means original maturity to the entity holding the investment. For example, both a three-month US Treasury bill and a three-year Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. However, a Treasury note purchased three years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months. Compensating balance arrangements that do not legally restrict the withdrawal or usage of cash amounts may be reported as Cash and Cash Equivalents, while legally restricted deposits held as compensating balances against borrowing arrangements, contracts entered into with others, or company statements of intention with regard to particular deposits should not be reported as cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents identified with this member are continuing operations only.

Following the completion of the decommissioning, if surplus funds remain in the decommissioning trusts, any excess funds will be refunded to the respective ratepayers.

This liability is the sum of the nuclear decommission trust fund asset, the nuclear decommissioning retirement obligation asset included within property, plant and equipment, less the nuclear decommissioning reserve. The total carrying value of all assets and liabilities associated with the decommissioning and the trusts net to zero and none of the activities related to the decommissioning of the STP nuclear facility are recorded in the income statement as ultimately the ratepayers in the state of Texas are liable for decommissioning the facility.

FinancialServicesCashAndCashEquivalentsAtCarryingValue	0001140361-09-017928	1	0	monetary	I	D	Cash and cash equivalents	Financial Services - Includes currency on hand as well as demand deposits with banks or financial institutions. It also includes other kinds of accounts that have the general characteristics of demand deposits in that the Entity may deposit additional funds at any time and also effectively may withdraw funds at any time without prior notice or penalty. Cash equivalents, excluding items classified as marketable securities, include short-term, highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity that they present minimal risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally, only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify under that definition. Original maturity means original maturity to the entity holding the investment. For example, both a three-month US Treasury bill and a three-year Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. However, a Treasury note purchased three years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months. Compensating balance arrangements that do not legally restrict the withdrawal or usage of cash amounts may be reported as Cash and Cash Equivalents, while legally restricted deposits held as compensating balances against borrowing arrangements, contracts entered into with others, or company statements of intention with regard to particular deposits should not be reported as cash and cash equivalents.

Cash equivalents, excluding items classified as marketable securities, include Short-Term, highly liquid Investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity that they present minimal risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally, only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify under that definition. Original maturity means original maturity to the entity holding the investment. For example, both a three-month US Treasury bill and a three-year Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. However, a Treasury note purchased three years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months. Short-term investments, exclusive of cash equivalents, are marketable securities intended to be sold within one year (or the normal operating cycle if longer) and include trading securities, available-for-sale securities, and held-to-maturity securities (if maturing within one year).
