### Actual Market Risk: LOW
inVisement meausre of actual financial risk is **the high yield bonds spread over risk free Treasuries**, which indicates a very low risk market (above chart) The market is celebrating with high stock prices. 

### Potential Risk Factors
The US economy is growing fast and unemployment rate is very low. But there are crawling risks that might turn the current bull into a bear:

- **Higher Interest Rates**
The Fed is concerned about the rising inflation and rasing prime rates to cool down the crawling inflation. It is raising but it is still about 2% which is low for a boom economic cycle.

    - Fed ability to manipulate interest rates (through higher prime rates) is often exaggerated. The past two months show the market interest rates were mainly stagnant. This is similar to the late 90s when the Federal Reserve was not able to harness the financial expansion.

    - The market demonstrates resilient to higher prime rates. Consumers keep spending, banks keep lending, stocks keep growing, and employers keep hiring.

- **Slowing Real Estate**. The number of homes sold has been decreasing for the past 6 months. This is the biggest sign of concern. The higher mortgage rates, caused by higher prime rate, has decreased the home buyers affordability. 

- **Trade Wars**
The White House believes in Mercantilism and it is too optimistic about the US ability to close the trade gap. The White House's "easy war to win" is a lose-lose game to everyone.

    - Mercantilism is a wrong but popular understanding about how economy works. The US trade deficit is natural and is a bless. It is caused by the "Capital Account Surplus". The US is world's capital market: while the US economy accounts for less than 20% of the world's economy, the US capital market is about 50% of the world's capital market. Therefore, it is natural (and healthy) to see the US attracts a tremendous capital inflow from the rest of the world, which means the US would have a huge trade deficit (excess imports over exports.) The US is the world's Manhattan.

    - Trade policies such as higher tariff would translate into **Stronger US Dollar** (the monetary substitution effect) and **Economic Inefficiencies** (the real economy substitution effect). Nonetheless, the White House has shown flexibility in reaching deals with its neighbors and the EU. The only big concern is the US trade war with China, which seems to be a (unfortunately) a popular policy. The market is strong enough to overcome this problem, especially through stronger dollar, but the White House Mercantilism view poses a real risk to the economy and the market, no doubt!

- **Skill Shortage**
The populist wrath against immigration, accompanied with low unemployment, might cause lack of skilled workers to fill the jobs that economy needs when growing faster than usual. This is one of the biggest threats for sustainability of the high economic growth.

### Perceived Market Risk

inVisement uses google trends "bull and bear spread" to measure the investors perceived market risk, which shows investors are **Cautious** (i.e. moderately bearish and highly sensitive to the current market prices).
