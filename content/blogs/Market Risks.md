The US economy is growing fast and unemployment rate is very low. The market is celebrating with high stock prices. But there are growing risks that might turn the bull into a bear.


### Inflation and Higher Interest Rates
The Fed is concerned about the rising inflation and would like to fold in some of past monetary expansions and quantitative easings.

- **Inflation** is rising but it seems not a big concern as it remains under 2% despite low unemployment rate.

- **Fed** ability to manipulate interest rate (through higher prime rates) is exagerated. The past two months shows the interest rates (especially long terms) do not follow prime rates. This is similar to late 90s when Fed was not able to harness the financial expansion.

- **Market and Economy** demonstrate resilient to higher prime rates. Consumers keep spending, banks keep lending, market keeps growing, and employers keep hiring.

- **Real Estate** is slowing down. This is the biggest sign of concern. Higher mortgage rates lowers home buyers affordability while many cities experiencing high prices. 

### Trade war
The White House believes in Merchantalism and also it is too optimistic about its ability to close the trade gap. The WHite House "easy war to win" is not a lose-lose to everyone.

- **Merchantalism** is wrong understanding of how economy works. The US trade deficit is natural and a bless, it is caused by "Capital Account Surplus". 

- **Trade policies** (liek higher tarrifs) would translate into **Stronger US Dollar** (the monetary substitution effect) and **Economic Inefficiencies** (the real economy substitution effect).

- **The White House** has shown flexibility in reaching deals with its neighbors and EU. The only big concern is China.

- **Market** is strong enough to overcome this problem, especially through stronger dollar but the White House Merchantalism view poses a real risk to the economy and the market, no doubt.

### Lack of skilled employees
The wave against immigration and low unemployment rate might cause the market searching for job skills that are not there. This is one of the biggest threats for high growth rates in near future.
