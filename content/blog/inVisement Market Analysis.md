Althoug the market (especially tech) is a little stretched but inVisement predicts a healthy growth.
title: "Market Analysis August 2018"

## Fundamentals
The US (and the rest of the world) enjoys high economic growth, low eomployment rate, and high capex investments. It has shown strength to tolerate trade war and higher prime rates.

Tech companies are monetizing their past innovations. Tech sector revenue growth exceeds 20% and often beats analysts expectations. The innovation engine (venture capitals and start-ups) is heavily invested and we expect more products, innovations, and distruptions to emerge.

One the other hand, investors are a little cautious not to experience what they did during the great recession (2008) or dot-com burst (2000). Moreover, the borrowing cost is not cheap anymore (prime-rate in near 3%).

## Market View
So the rsult is periods of growth by speculations followed by adjustments days during earning calls. After each earning season, investors start speculating about the future of the tech stocks. They keep betting on which ones will run faster. Meanwhile, the tech companies keep growing and dragging the rest of the economy. During the earning calls, adjustments will happen. Companies who could not live up to the expectations would fall back to the previous quarter prices (Ex: Twitter and Facebook) but will jump if they surpass the expectations (Ex: Amazon and Alphabet and Apple).


## Speculate and Adjust

We call the current market, especially the Tech sector, "speculate and adjust", which means moderate growth with high volatility.

- **High Volatility**: The market will keep experiencing high volatility. There will be frequent adjustments periods in which market will tumble to adjust itself to cold fact and figures emerging from earning calls.

- **Hold**: The maket will look like a  very bumpy ascending hike. Growing slowly and constantly (caused by speculations on tech revenue growth) accompanied with little burts and price adjustmentss every month or so. inVisement thinks it is a healthy market, growing but cautious. We keep our positions while adding to our cash reserves.

- 15% Cash
- 25% call options for QQQ, SPY, DIA, AAPL, and GS
