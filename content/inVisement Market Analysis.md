# Bear or Bull


There is an ongoing debate about tech bubble, similar to dot-com bubble burst.
What does inVisement think?

We call the current market, especially the Tech sector, "speculate and correct", which means overall growth with high volatility.

The US (and world) economy is exceptionally good (historical growth rate, low eomployment rate, high investment) in a way that it can tolerate trade war rant by White House and higher prime-rates by Federal Reserve without a sweat.

Tech companies are monetizing from innovations of their past. Tech sector revenue and earning is growing 20%+ annually and they keep beating the market pessimism. The innovation engine (venture capital and start-up market) is heavily invested and we should expect more products, innovations, and distruptions to emerge.

One the other hand, investors are a little cautious not to experience what they did during the great recession (2008) or dot-com burst (2000). Moreover, the borrowing cost is not so cheap (prime-rate in near 3%).

So the rsult is periods of growth by speculation followed by correction days caused by cold facts. After each quarter earning calls, investors start speculating about the future of the tech stocks. They keep betting on which one will run faster. Meanwhile, the tech companies keep growing and pulling the rest of the economy. During the earning calls, corrections happen. Companies who could not live up to the expectations would fall back to the previous quarter prices (Ex: Twitter and Facebook) but if they surpass the expectations, they will jump (Ex: Amazon and Alphabet and Apple).

Off course, there would be overall correction of the expectations as well. A good earning call season makes investors bullish and less-than-expected earning call makes them bearish about the overal market.

From inVisement perspective:

- The fundamentals of the economy and money market is strong. Nothing is predictable but it seems the horizon is clear and there is no big, thick, dark cloud in sky.

- The market has more room to grow and it will keep growing, expecially the tech sector. We predict 20%+ annual growth rate (equal to revenue growth) for tech companies (NASDAQ-100) and 10%+ annual growth for total market (S&P 500).

- The market will keep experiencing high volatility. There will be frequent correction periods in which market will tumble to adjust itself to cold fact and figures emerging from earning calls.

- The maket will look like a  very bumpy ascending hike. Growing slowly and constantly (caused by speculations on tech revenue growth) accompanied with little burts and price corrections every month or so. We think it is a healthy market, upbeat and cautious. We keep investing while adding to our cash slowly.

- Right now, inVisement portfolio is consist of 25% Cash, 25% tech stocks (GOOGL, AAPL, CRM, SQ, TWTR, MDB, GS), 50% Buy Call options (on SPY and QQQ and DIA), 10% Buy Put options (on AMZN and NFLX). Our beta is about 3 times bigger than QQQ. We are aiming at 30% return by end of year (mostly from our call options).
